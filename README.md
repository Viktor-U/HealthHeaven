Hello, this is my project HealthHeaven, which uses Spring for server side, React Vite(JSX) for client side and MySQL database.
My project is a site that allows users to shop for various medications, as well as access doctors that only the Admin can add and edit.
Users also have access to various articles that they can comment on or simply create their own, the role of the Admin is to monitor for inaccuracies and delete those that he deems unnecessary or irregular.
User without registration is not allowed to view details of products, doctors or articles, as well as create articles or use the shopping cart on the site, only has access to the home page, all articles, all doctors and
all products, but not to access them individually. The client has the option to choose from the languages ​​Bulgarian and English. The site also provides various pages with articles, as well as the ability to sort them by date.

With the project open, go into appConfig in the config folder and follow the instructions to add data, but after viewing the site with no data.
